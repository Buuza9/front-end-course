1. By changing only the display property of the CSS make all 3 squares line up horizontally like in goal1 image.
if we want all the elements to be dsiplayed horizontally we will set
the display property of each element to inline-block, which is a mix of inline and block display
like inline as in the element will be displayed on the same line if there was enough space, otherwise it will
displayed on the next line. and on the other hand, like block, which you can set the height and width of an element.
2. Change only the display property to make all 3 squares line up vertically like in goal2 image. 
to display all the squares lined up vertically then we will set the display property to block.
